1. Visual Philosophy: “Soft Futurism for Institutions”

Granto blends enterprise seriousness (universities, grants, governance) with modern softness (glassmorphism, gradients, neumorphism).

Core traits

Calm, confident, not playful

Modern but not trendy

Feels premium, not flashy

Designed for long daily use

Rule: If a UI element feels loud, sharp, or aggressive — it doesn’t belong.

2. Layout & Spatial System
Container Discipline

Content is always centered and width-constrained

Typical max widths:

Hero text: ~950px

Dashboards / data surfaces: 1100–1200px

Principle

Wide enough for dashboards, narrow enough for focus.

Grid Usage

12-column grid for complex layouts

Cards span logical groupings (8/4, 7/5, etc.)

Avoid arbitrary spans — everything should feel intentional

Rule

Primary content → bigger span
Secondary content → smaller span
Tertiary content → visually lighter

Spacing Rhythm

Everything follows a modular spacing scale:

--space-2 → micro

--space-4 → element separation

--space-6/8 → card padding

--space-12/16 → section separation

Principle

Never hardcode random spacing values. Use the scale.

3. Typography System
Hierarchy (Very Important)

Typography does most of the visual work — not borders or colors.

Level	Usage
H1	Big vision statements
H2	Section intent
H3	Card purpose
Body	Calm, readable, generous line-height
Meta	Uppercase, letter-spaced, subtle

Rules

Large headings use tight line-height

Body text uses 1.5–1.6 line-height

Meta labels are:

Uppercase

Small font

Increased letter spacing

Font Weight Strategy

700 → Headings & emphasis

600 → Labels, metrics

500 → Body text

Avoid thin weights

Granto feels confident, not delicate.

4. Color Philosophy
Neutral-First Palette

Most of the UI lives in:

Whites

Soft grays

Transparent layers

Primary color is accentual, not dominant.

Rule

If everything is colored, nothing is important.

Accent Usage

Primary color is used for:

CTAs

Key metrics

Active state indicators

Small labels / chips

Never:

Full-page fills

Large backgrounds (except CTA blocks)

Gradients

Used sparingly, mainly for:

Hero text emphasis

Background atmospherics

Not for:

Buttons

Cards

Data surfaces

5. Card & Surface Language
Card Types

Granto uses three surface styles:

Neumorphic Cards

Soft shadow

Elevated but calm

Primary dashboard elements

Glass Panels

Backdrop blur

Semi-transparent

Secondary / contextual content

Solid Cards

Used for CTAs or highlights

High contrast, minimal detail

Rule

Choose card style based on importance, not aesthetics.

Borders & Shadows

Borders are subtle and often white or light gray

Shadows are:

Large

Diffuse

Low opacity

No sharp or dark shadows.

6. Data Visualization Language
Simulated, Not Noisy

Charts are:

Minimal

Contextual

Supporting, not dominating

Rules

No grid lines unless needed

Limited color usage

Labels are tiny and secondary

Metrics

Circular progress rings

Clear numeric focus

Label comes after the value

Numbers first. Explanations second.

7. Interaction & UI Behavior
Buttons

Large padding

Rounded

Bold text

Primary buttons are calm, not aggressive

Primary vs Secondary:

Primary → Solid

Secondary → Outline or glass

Role Awareness

UI adapts subtly to roles:

Lecturer

Admin

System

This shows up as:

Badges

Labels

Contextual indicators

The UI acknowledges who you are without screaming it.

8. Brand Consistency Rules
Tone

Professional

Aspirational

Institutional

No slang

No marketing fluff

Iconography

Minimal

Purpose-driven

Emoji only in controlled, symbolic contexts (🏛️, 🏥)

9. Design Guardrails (For Future Screens)

When designing any new screen, ask:

Is the primary intent obvious in 3 seconds?

Is hierarchy clear without color?

Could this live comfortably next to the dashboard?

Does this feel calm at 9am and 9pm?

If yes → it fits Granto.

10. One-Line Design North Star

Granto should feel like a quiet, intelligent system that makes complex academic work feel ordered, transparent, and dignified.
